Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

what is != and where should you use it?
put ! before something, like !user_name
put ! after something, like words.uniq!
put ? before something
put ? after something
put !! before something, like !!user_name

Answer:

! is the bang and not character. It can be used for mutative methods. It can also give the inverse of a boolean.
? asserts a true or false return from a method.

1. != means not equal to. Used for conditionals.
2. !variable converts to false. !false converts to true.
3. ! after a method will make it destructive if possible.
4. Ternary operator?
5. Signifies method will return true or false statement. Method code determines output, not because it has a ?. 
6. Double inverse. Returns as true.
